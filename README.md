"Supplier Query Management UI"

This project helps QA teams in food companies track questions they send to suppliers. Usually these questions get lost in email threads, so the goal here is to make a clear place to send a query and follow its status easily.

Problem Being Solved

1.QA managers often need information from suppliers (like allergen details, certificate dates, safety confirmations).
2.Many times these get lost in emails, and tracking becomes messy.
3.This interface gives them one clean screen to manage and follow queries.

What the UI Lets the User Do
1.View all suppliers and their query status (Pending, Resolved, urgent,In progress)
2.Raise a new query using a simple and understandable form
3.Track the status of submitted queries.

User Flow

Select Supplier → Submit Query → View Status

Design Thinking

I tried to keep the interface very straightforward and stress-free for the user.

Key choices:


1.Clean layout with enough spacing so nothing feels crowded

2.Simple form with only necessary fields to reduce effort

3.Clear status indicators with text + color for easy scanning

4.Consistent styling so the screens feel connected and smooth to navigate

Goal was to make it feel lightweight instead of corporate and overwhelming.

Accessibility Considerations

1.Readable text and clean contrast

2.Form labels are clearly visible

3.Status colors supported with text (helpful for color-blind users)

4.Buttons and clickable areas spaced comfortably


🛠️ Tech Stack
